# Text Editor

## Task: To create a program that works as a networking API locally.
* Goal: To create a text editor application that runs in the browser. It will operate as a single page application and act as a progressive web application (PWA).
* Specifications: The content within the editor must save when the window is unfocused, it needs to work without an internet connection, it will use babel for async/await, and it will have the capability of being installed as a PWA. 
* Points of Emphasis: This project will use IndexedDB for object storage and route methods, use webpack to neatly bundle the application, use a service worker with workbox so that static assets can be cached. 
* Completion: This project is completed when fully functioning application including the necessary files are pushed and submitted into a github repository. Then the link to the live application is shown here:  https://hidden-plateau-11846.herokuapp.com/
